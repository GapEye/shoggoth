SHOGGOTH
===============================================================================

Shoggoth is a peer-to-peer, anonymous network for publishing and distributing open-source code, Machine Learning models, datasets, and research papers.

To join the Shoggoth network, there is no registration or approval process. Nodes and clients operate anonymously with identifiers decoupled from real-world identities.

Anyone can freely join the network and immediately begin publishing or accessing resources.

The purpose of Shoggoth is to combat software censorship and empower software developers to create and distribute software, without a centralized hosting service or platform.

Shoggoth is developed and maintained by Shoggoth Systems (https://shoggoth.systems), and its development is funded by donations and sponsorships.
